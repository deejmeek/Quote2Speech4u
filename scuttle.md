Project Name: Quote2Speech4u

# Quote2Speech4u

//UI/Style-

Widget in the center of the screen that is the interface for activating the quote2speech(q2s).

When the widget is pressed/clicked the quote is displayed and read to the user,

the widget also animates/breathes when pressed.

The widget deactivates ideally when the text-to-speech is finished.

otherwise it will be a intense breathe followed by a very gradual relax to its natural state.

The widget is not able to be pressed until it has completed its sequence.

Need to initiate quote api to call and display quoite text

then once t2s is initated investigate whether i can link conditions to the api deactivating or activating.
